Code for the paper is coming soon

## Environment
clone repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/zengxianyu/jsws.git
git submodule init 
git submodule update
```

prepare environment:
```
conda env create --file=pytorch_environments.yml
```

## Prepare Data
Required training data: 
* PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation dataset. We only use image-level class labels of them. Put the folder ```VOC2012``` in ```data/datasets/segmentation_Dataset/VOCdevkit/```. I include 10,582 extra training samples introduced by Hariharan et al [15]; unzip SegmentationClassAug.zip and put it in VOCdevkit
* DUTS saliency dataset training split. Put the folder ```DUT-train``` in ```data/datasets/saliency_Dataset/```
* (Optional) ECSSD dataset for test and validation on saliency task.  Put the folder ```ECSSD``` in ```data/datasets/saliency_Dataset/```


## Train stage 1
train using image-level class labels and saliency ground-truth:

```shell
weak_seg_full_sal_train.py
```

Open http://host ip:8000/savefiles/jlsfcn_dense169.html in a browser for visualizing training process. 

It should be easy to achieve MIOU>54 but you may need to try multiple times to get the score MIOU 57.1 or more than that in Table. 5 of the paper. 

## Train stage 2
train a more complex model using the prediction of the model trained in the stage 1. 

1. make training data

```
weak_seg_full_sal_syn.py
```

2. train (optional: processing by [densecrf](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf))

```
self_seg_full_sal_train.py
```

## Test
stage 1 model:
```
weak_seg_full_sal_test.py
```

stage 2 model
```
self_seg_full_sal_test.py
```
By default it calls the function ```test(...)``` to test on segmentation task

Change to call the function ```test_sal(...)``` to test on saliency task
